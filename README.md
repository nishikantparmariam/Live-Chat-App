Live Chat is a chatting android mobile application which sends information in real time. It provides an elegant, simple and easy to use UI. The app has a very special feature for engaging and increasing users (Point System where every user earns points for using the app).
The app is designed in Android Studio, the back-end of the app is coded in JAVA while the front-end uses XML. The app uses Googleâ€™s Firebase for authentication, managing users and real-time data syncing.

# Salient Features
1) It provides a secure login, sign-up and resetting password system. Hence no user can use the app without
logging in.
2) It collects information like full name, email, password, and while signing up it allows exactly one user
account over one email ID. The app firstly makes the account with a very basic user profile picture, this
can be changed by the user later easily.
3) The app has a Point System for every user. A user gets some points for using the app. This feature helps
in engaging users and makes the app unique from the existing apps in the market.
4) A user can search for any user who uses the app and can see who is online/offline in real time.
5) A user can start a new chat ( or continue old one ) after searching people just by clicking the user.
Whenever a user starts a new chat (personal chat) some points are added in the account of both the
users.
6) While chatting a user can see if the other person is online/offline, typing a message or the other person
has seen (green tick) my message or not. A user can send text messages, emojis in the keyboard. He/she
can also see the time of sending the message.
7) The app also provides a facility for group chat. A user has to just make a new group by providing a name
and add people to start group chatting. Every user gets equal points for joining the chat. Every message in
a group chat also shows how many users have seen the message.
8) Every user can see his chats and can also see if a chat has a new message/unseen message or not.
9) A user can send images also.
10) If the user is offline he can still use the app, if he sends a message then it is shown in the chat and is
stored locally and whenever the internet connection is available the message is sent automatically.
