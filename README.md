Live Chat is a chatting android mobile application which sends information in real time. It provides an elegant, simple and easy to use UI. The app has a very special feature for engaging and increasing users (Point System where every user earns points for using the app).
The app is designed in Android Studio, the back-end of the app is coded in JAVA while the front-end uses XML. The app uses Googleâ€™s Firebase for authentication, managing users and real-time data syncing.
